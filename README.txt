The purpose of this project is to simulate an Electronics Health Records web application. There will be a validated Log-In page and a page for entry of patient information. The goal is to set up the page such that upon successful validation of log-in credentials, the user will be directed to a page for entering patient information which could then be submitted to a database. I chose this form because I would like to create a fully functioning Electronic Health Records system in the future.
Thank you,
David M. Hahn
